# Game Jam Kickoff

Theme: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Execute these steps in order:

### 1. Brainstorm (2 min)
Generate 3 game ideas that fit the theme. For each:
- One sentence description
- Core mechanic
- Why it's doable in 48-72 hours

### 2. Pick One
Choose the most promising idea based on:
- Scope (smaller = better for jams)
- Fun factor (is the core loop engaging?)
- Team skill match

### 3. Choose Engine
Based on the game idea, pick:
- **Godot** - For 2D games, quick iteration
- **Unity** - For 3D or if team knows C#
- **Phaser.js** - For web-only, JavaScript team

Read `./skills/game-engines/SKILL.md` for setup patterns.

### 4. Create Project Structure
Set up folders:
```
./src/
./assets/
./builds/
```

### 5. Initialize Design Doc
Create `./docs/GAME_DESIGN.md` with:
- Game title (can be placeholder)
- One-paragraph description
- Core mechanic explanation
- MVP feature list (3-5 features max)
- Stretch goals (if time permits)

### 6. Initialize Task Board
Create `./docs/TASKS.md` with initial tasks split by team member.

### 7. First Code
Create the main game file with:
- Basic game loop
- Player placeholder
- One core mechanic started

Output a summary of what you created and what the team should do next.
