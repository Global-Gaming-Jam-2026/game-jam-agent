### 2. Locate
- Find the relevant code

- Identify the root cause (not just symptoms)

### 3. Fix
Apply the simplest fix that works. Options:
- Fix the bug properly (if quick)
- Workaround (if proper fix is complex)
- Disable feature (if blocking and no time)

### 4. Verify
- Confirm the fix works
- Check you didn't break something else

### 5. Explain
Tell the user:

- What you fixed
- Why it happened (so team learns)
- Any remaining concerns

Keep explanation SHORT. Devs are busy during jams.
