# Playtest Review

Notes from playtest: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

### 1. Analyze Feedback
Categorize issues:
- **Bugs** - Things that are broken
- **Feel** - Things that don't feel right (controls, timing, feedback)
- **Content** - Missing or lacking content
- **Polish** - Nice-to-haves (juice, effects, sounds)

### 2. Prioritize
Rank by impact and effort:

| Priority | Fix If |
|----------|--------|
| P0 | Game-breaking, must fix |
| P1 | Hurts fun significantly, quick fix |
| P2 | Noticeable but playable |
| P3 | Nice to have, skip if short on time |

### 3. Quick Wins
Identify and implement any fixes that:
- Take < 5 minutes
- Significantly improve feel
- Reference `./skills/gameplay-mechanics/SKILL.md` for juice/feedback patterns

### 4. Update Task Board
Add prioritized issues to `./docs/TASKS.md`

### 5. Recommend
Tell the team:
- Top 3 things to fix next
- What to cut if running low on time
- Current state assessment (on track / behind / ahead)
