[What you created]

## How to Play
[Controls and objective]

## How to Test
[Commands to run the game]

## What's Next
[What you'll add if there's time]
```

## CODE STYLE

### Priority:
1. **Works** - Playable
2. **Stable** - No crashes
3. **Fun** - Feels good
4. Clean and optimized can wait

### Speed Practices:
- Copy-paste from skills, adapt later
- Use simplest solution that works
- Don't refactor until it's broken
- Placeholder art is fine

## TIME MANAGEMENT

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| First 20% | Core mechanic working |
| Next 40% | Add features, basic art |
| Next 30% | Polish, juice, sound |
| Last 10% | Bug fixes, build, submit |

**Don't wait for:**
- Perfect art
- All planned features
- Edge case handling

**DECIDE. BUILD. SHIP.**
